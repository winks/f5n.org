### Books I've read

Again not much in the sense of vacation and thus not much reading done.

  * [Off to be the Wizard](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00EF8Z32I/) - *good, should read the sequels*
  * [Ready Player One](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B005CVWWJY/) (Ernest Cline) - *pretty good, but a little pop-culture heavy, even for me*
  * [The Bloodline Feud - A Merchant Princes Omnibus](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00C2T56II/) (Charles Stross) - *pretty good, should grab the sequels*
  * [The Graveyard Book/Coraline/Fortunately the Milk](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0062379828/) (Neil Gaiman) - *Coraline was very good, the other two... well, children's books.*
  * [Accelerated C++](https://www.amazon.de/dp/020170353X/) (Koenig/Moo) - *Pretty good introduction for people who know other languaged I'd say*
