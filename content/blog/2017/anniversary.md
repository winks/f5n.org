I've kinda stopped blogging regularly, I think I've migrated mostly to Twitter
like many people did. Some weeks I found enough interesting (at least to me
and as I hope, to my roughly five readers) links to post an update to The
Stack, but not much in the way of real content. Words, pictures, essays? Ok,
mostly rants.
I'm still posting stuff on various websites, but not in this "blog" format,
maybe because I didn't want this iteration of "my personal website" to be
daily journal back in 2011 when I went live. Maybe for some other reason.

Anyway, I found the oldest posting in one of my earliest blogs - it's dated
September, 11th 2000 - at 20:09:48 (not sure if UTC or German time). It's
the id:1 post in the database that's run until 2005-06-12 when I
completely moved to the blog where I mostly wrote about studying, it's still
[online](http://www.codeschmie.de) and I stopped posting there at the end
of 2011, a bit after this site went live.
So this is kind of a 17 year anniversary - because I have no clue when I
*really* started, if it was late '98, somewhere in '99, or earlier in 2000,
my guess is 1999 as I found another website that apparently went live in '99 -
but that first entry talks about a new design and porting content. Sadly the
oldest snapshot on archive.org is also from September 2000 and it has no
content at all - so I just don't know when I moved to that domain and I also
don't remember if I was already blogging on that Geocities website I had
before.

Summary, because I kept having to amend stuff all the time:

 * 1999? - 2000-08 :: Geocities?
 * 2000-09 - 2002-12 :: first blog on own domain
 * 2003-01 - 2005-06 :: blog at munich.art-core.org
 * 2004-10 - 2011-12 :: blog at codeschmie.de
 * 2011-06 - now :: blog at f5n.org
 * other stuff
  * 2004-02 - 2005-09 :: first gaming blog about Ragnarok Online
  * 2007 :: second gaming blog about World of Warcraft
  * 2009 - now :: third gaming blog
