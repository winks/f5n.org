When I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBenttZUT7A#t=3m30s), for the second time
this week I found myself talking about a movie that came out in 1997. Time flies.

The good stuff (or well-known, in case of Titanic):

- [Princess Mononoke](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119698/)
- [The Fifth Element](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/)
- [Starship Troopers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120201/)
- [Titanic](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/)
- [Men In Black](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/)
- [Gattaca](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/)
- [Con Air](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118880/)
- [The Devil's Advocate](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118971/)
- [Jackie Brown](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119396/)
- [Life is Beautiful](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/)
- [The Jackal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119395/)
- [The Saint](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120053/)
- [Smilla's Sense of Snow](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120152/) (didn't know the book back then)


Plus the movies I never watched, but actually wanted to at some point

- [Anastasia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118617/) (Disney)
- [Chasing Amy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118842/) (Kevin Smith)
- [Wag the Dog](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120885/)
- [Fierce Creatures](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119115/)


But not all was good in 1997:

- [Batman & Robin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/)
- [Event Horizon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119081/)
- [Cube](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123755/)
- [Spawn](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120177/)
- [Speed 2: Cruise Control](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120179/)
- [Spice World](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120185/)


And maybe it seems so different because I was a huge movie fan back then (and don't really watch
much these days) but 1997 seems to have been quite a year.
