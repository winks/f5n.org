Today is a weird day. First I read about [Snikket][snikket] (in a HN comment
I guess), which sounds pretty awesome - a curated set of tools for XMPP (i.e.
server, web client, iOS + Android client) that are deliberately modified to
work well together, just as it should've been from the start, and not everyone
using different extensions and interacting being so painful at times...
But for me this is like 5-8 years too late and I'm probably not
going back to XMPP, I'm happy on Matrix for a certain set of people and I
guess I lost contact with the ones on Jabber years ago anyway, or it's via
Twitter or IRC or sometimes WhatsApp...

Then the news broke that Elon Musk is buying Twitter and for some reason there
was a huge renewed interest in the fediverse again and the bigger servers
seemed to be fighting with capacity a little. And by "for some reason" I meant
that nothing actually has changed, it's just some event where everyone seems
to get an impulse to check it out. I'm not saying that as a completely remote
observer though, I did indeed log in to my fediverse accounts for the first
time in weeks, and before that it had been months. Anyway, we'll see how that
will pan out, the fediverse has never worked out for me because none of the
200 people I follow were actually being active over there.

It doesn't help that many instances have gone away since 2018-2020 and so
there are a lot of empty references in my following list which I should
probably prune at some point, at least if I would be active.

Back in 2017 (I think) I actually tried self-hosting (on a domain I no longer
own, so again part of the problem), but the setup for just one user was just
so overly complex and the software still buggy (I think I tried Mastodon and
Pleroma) that I just scrapped the attempt and went to chaos.social for German
content and mastodon.social for English content - I've never been a fan of
bilingual interactions on Twitter.

I am not sure the landscape of self-hosting is a lot better today, someone
posted [this list][delight] and half of the applications are either declared
as unfinished/beta and/or have not seen an update in years, which wouldn't be
a problem if they were a little more mature and finished, but none of them
look like it. So maybe I'll be trying out [honk][honk] or [ktistec][ktistec].

And then I saw [Blog more, tweet less][blogmore] and remembered my attemps to
add IndiePub support into this site. Maybe I should just try to add something
regarding ActivityPub and have the canonical source and then publish to either
Twitter or the Fediverse... But oh well, does it actually matter? I put my
Twitter account to private months (or years?) ago, I only have 150 people
there, I haven't counted how many of those accounts are still active and so
on, so "do I actually have any benefits besides appeasing FOMO" is a real
concern. Self-hosting is nice, but not for the sake of it, the tool should
have a purpose. And maybe this is something where I'm better off just using
someone else's infra because it's just not important enough for me.

Also there are some [valid concerns][vc], mostly related to piggybacking on
other people's instances, but the problem (see above) of just hosting your
own persists. Maybe I should read [Run your own social][run] again, but I'm
not sure there's anything new I haven't thought about.

Maybe this sounded like random rambling about unrelated topics but the gist
of it is that I've been thinking about the communication channels I have used
and am using quite a bit and for several of them I've never been really happy.
The question is if moving to the fediverse would change anything about that
or if there's a need for something else yet again...
