I'm a big fan of in-ear headphones when outside. I wear them when going for a
longer walk, when using public transport, and when cycling I usually have
one bud in on low volume for a little background music. So far, nothing
revolutionary about that, many people do that. Over-ears are not a feasible
alternative for me, I've tried it a few times.

Many years ago I discovered the perfect in-ear, but I don't really remember
how. Maybe someone posted a link to a sale on IRC, maybe I read a review.

I am talking about the Xiaomi Piston V3 from around 2015.

Last time I checked I couldn't find them to be ordered anymore, but I still
had one working pair (I'm not saying they're not sturdy, but using them 5-6
days a week, and folding them at least twice takes its toll, and I didn't
actually wear out that many pairs...) and didn't need them a lot the last two
years and I seem to have misplaced it. So I grabbed a HTC one I had in my
"backup headphones from phones and whatever" box and used that for a bit.

Two weeks ago or so I went to Mediamarkt to buy something else and checked the
headphone aisle, didn't see anything interesting, but near the checkout they
had some JBL T160 and because they were cheap and I was kinda happy with JBL
in the past (I have a small Bluetooth speaker made by them) I grabbed a pair.

And boy do these sound shit. No bass at all, the cable is very slim and flat
and a little awkward, and the controls are in a weird place. Like directly at
your collar. Also they fall out of my ears easily, but I might just have to
try the other plastic nubs.

So yeah, I know I shouldn't expect great sound for 13 EUR (although the
Piston V3 have that), but come on, sounding worse than the HTC ones they give
you for free on a cheap/medium phone line? (Could have been the Tattoo from
2009 or the Desire Z from 2013ish).

So I guess I will put them in my bag as the new "backup in case I forgot to
bring some" headphones and continue using the HTC ones and see if I can
track down a few more pairs of Xiaomi Piston V3. Sad as it is.

Between writing this and publishing it I actually found one set of the Pistons
in my drawer, so I guess I'm good for 1-2 years...
