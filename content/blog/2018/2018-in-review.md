  * bash - *still too much*

### Podcasts I listen to

Very irregular this year:

  * [Battle Bards](http://battlebards.libsyn.com/) - *"A musical journey through MMO soundscapes"*
  * [ATP](http://atp.fm/) - *I'm not using any Apple products and still listen to these guys sometimes.*
  * [noclip](https://www.noclip.video) - *awesome documentaries/podcasts*
  * some real gaming podcasts, but even less regularly

TLDR: This is even less quantifiable than last year, I'm kind of confused where all the time went.
Didn't watch much in the first half of the year, didn't read, didn't play much. Played more in the second half
of the year and watched a few more movies than in the last years. No shows that take a lot of time though.
