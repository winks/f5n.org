So yesterday the lunar eclipse was supposed to be seen quite nicely and as I
usually complain that my balcony only gets sun during breakfast time and is
no use to sit there in the evening because it's going out to the east...
at least I could try to watch the lunar eclipse from 21:30 to 23:13 (00:54).

Pictures (taken with a Sony DSC-RX100) aren't terribly good, but it was what
was available and still ok.

I know I've been doing it wrong, I like the last two pictures taken at 00:30
when the real eclipse was already over a lot more.

Oh and of course I
[had to be reminded](https://need.computer/photos/mondfinsternis-2018.html)
to actually post some photos...
