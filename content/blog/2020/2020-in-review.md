  * Borderlands 3 - *had started in 2019, was still playing at the start of the year*


### Books I've read

Zero novels and one technical book ("Database Internals" by Alex Petrov). An alarming trend continues.

I started with both "Laika's Window" by Kurt Caswell and "A Guide To The Good Life" by William B. Irvine though.


### Movies I've (re-)watched

  * Rise of the Guardians - *discussions about whether this is a Christmas movie aside, it was very funny*
  * Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - *the best Spider-Man movie, one of the best Marvel movies*


## TV Series I've (re-)watched

  * Dr. Oakley - Yukon Vet on Disney+ - *no idea why, but I really liked it*
  * Encore on Disney+ - *stopped after 2-3 episodes*
  * The Mandalorian on Disney+ - *it's Star Wars and I didn't like it. Weird.


## CDs I bought

  * Nightwish - Human II Nature
  * Nightwish - Endless Forms Most Beautiful
  * Sabaton - The Last Stand
  * Sabaton - The Great War


### Other stuff I bought

  * moto X4 64 GB - *my Nexus 5X died, so I needed a phone. 190 EUR and completely happy after 10 months*
  * a Geforce RTX 3070


### Social network usage

  * Twitter - *no change - regularly, not overly much*
  * Facebook - *not sure I logged in even once this year*
  * Instagram - *not sure I logged in even once this year*
  * Fediverse - *back for a short stint, mostly not*


### Messaging

  * IRC - *daily use, default communication channel for many people I communicate with*
  * Matrix - *daily use*
  * MS Teams - *work stuff*
  * Email - *same as usual*
  * Slack - *using two communities, sparingly, but one is a different one than last year*
  * WhatsApp - *kinda unavoidable*


### Trips

  * other countries: zero
  * other German states: zero
  * one actual holiday trip, cycling in the summer
  * one trip for a family birthday party, under protest


### (Online) services

  * Still subscribed to Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime, but I don't personally use them a lot
  * Mostly MMO subscriptions this year


### Programming languages used, roughly in order of hours spent

  * C++ - *work, I came to terms with the fact that it won't be my favorite language*
  * Python [for AoC](/blog/2020/advent-of-code-2020/) and other small stuff
  * bash - *still too much*
  * PHP - *just a little, for one private project*

### Podcasts I listen to

Very irregular this year:

  * [ATP](http://atp.fm/) - *I'm not using any Apple products and still listen to these guys sometimes.*
  * some real gaming podcasts, but even less regularly


### Stuff that kinda worked out

  * I don't have a real podcast downloader (yet), but I have something like trakt but for podcasts (mentioned last year)
  * be able to read cyrillic letters fluently and practice enough to memorize them (mentioned last year)
  * not going bonkers while confined to the apartment for most of the year


### Stuff I planned to do this year but didn't

  * more blog posts
  * do more Rust
  * do more Clojure
  * "focus on one or two languages for hobby stuff" - focused on zero languages, only wrote very little (C++, Python, PHP)
  * read at least 3 novels this year
  * more cycling, more mountain biking - the former fell flat because of perma-WFH and no motivation, the latter because of the pandemic
  * watch Hamilton

### "New Year's Resolutions" aka stuff that would be nice if it would work out

  * starting a new job in February, so of course I hope it will be a good gig
  * (more) mountain biking in the summer
