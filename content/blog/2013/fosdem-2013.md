I got the offer by my employer [Mayflower](http://www.mayflower.de) to go to
[Puppet Camp Ghent](http://puppetcampghent2013.eventbrite.com/) and also
[FOSDEM 2013](http://www.fosdem.org) this year and so I gladly accepted the
offer. There were actually 6 more colleagues coming along, a respectable size
for a travel group.

We decided to take a 7:00 plane (which is kind of a bad idea when your airport
isn't actually near the city) from Munich to Brussels on Thursday, which wasn't
a problem in itself, it just turns out that 9:09 train from
[Brussel Nationaal Luchthaven](http://www.brusselsairport.be) to Ghent takes
90min when there's one doing the trip in 30min. Ah well, why wouldn't anything
go wrong on a trip, so it better be over soon.

Despite Google Maps giving us weird directions we managed to walk to the Venue
and only miss the first two talks (which is a shame because after I talked to
Eric Sorenson at the evening event I would've loved to see his).

So I watched 3 talks and then spent the afternoon chatting with people. That
actually was so fun and interesting that I missed the talk about "exec" I
wanted to attend.

After that we went to put our stuff in the hotel rooms and grab a quick dinner,
then headed for the drinks event. There I had some beer, got to know even more
people, talked to the folks from afternoon again, played some billiards, had
some more beer and then went to sleep when the bartender poked us to go home.

So unfair, there were nearly as many Belgians there at the end :P

Anyway, on Friday morning there were even more talks and the afternoon spent
chatting with people, before we went to Brussels (this time taking a fast
train though :P) and getting to our hotel there.

Found a nice Italian restaurant for dinner (which was fun with 2 people
ordering in French, 2 people ordering in Italian and 1 in English) and then
went to the Beer Event.

As this was my first FOSDEM I was a bit dismayed how crowded and airless the
venue for the beer event was. No chance at all to find the one guy I had
actually made plans to meet. We only had one beer then decided to go
somewhere else which proved to be very good idea. I did see 2 people whose
blogs I read through Planets, but that's actually not something to strike up
a conversation with (in these cases) so headcount of people met: 0.

On Saturday at FOSDEM I first went into Peter Saint-Andre's talk "XMPP 101"
on the slim chance to learn something new, but more to have seen him talk,
he's done his share to make XMPP awesome after all. I then went to
"Whatâ€™s wrong with php?" which wasn't bad, but too short and a bit onesided.
Met someone I knew from Hamburg's PHP Unconference and had a little chat about
PHP release policy and adoption, visited the BuddyCloud booth, asked for a
Jenkins sticker, talked a little to one of the booth guys: "Thanks for doing
Jenkins, we love it." - "Hey, we got an evangelist, take another sticker."

By pure chance I noticed there was a ZeroMQ BoF planned, so I rushed there to
catch the folks just in time as they were heading for the bar, then talked for
a while with [Ian](http://twitter.com/ianbarber) and
[Pieter](http://twitter.com/hintjens) and some more people whose names I
didn't manage to memorize. Sadly there was no latenight plane home, so mine was
supposed to start at ~17:00 so that I left at 15:00 basically mid-conversation,
which really sucked :( The plane got delayed so I might've taken 30 more
minutes but I don't plan to miss one anytime soon, so the timing was actually
ok.


Interesting stuff I learnt about:

  * [Vagueant](https://github.com/neerolyte/vagueant) - "vaguely like Vagrant
    for linux containers (lxc)" which
    [Frank](https://twitter.com/Frank_Scholten) mentioned
  * [PuppetDB](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb) - it is
    written in Clojure, let the code reading begin :)
  * [puppet-playground](https://github.com/example42/puppet-playground) and
    [puppi](https://github.com/example42/puppi)

Summary:

  * Puppet Camp was awesome, most talks I watched were really good, some were
    just ok, but none was bad.
  * FOSDEM could've actually been even more awesome if I had time to catch up
    with and meet everyone I've corresponded with online in the past
  * Met some folks again after a few months/over a year, met some new folks
  * Don't go to FOSDEM only on one day
  * You might be interested/involved in too many technologies if you know
    people by name, face or nick from Linux Kernel, Debian, Red Hat, Python,
    PHP, FreeBSD, XMPP, GNOME, GRML, ZeroMQ (from the top of my head)

People I wanted to say hi to but missed:

  * @mr_ud, @mikagrml and @ch2500 (GRML guys who I met in Graz)
  * @mgdm and @h (PHP)


Thanks:

  * Mayflower for travel
  * Booking.com for free drinks
  * PuppetLabs and Inuits for organizing PuppetCamp
  * FOSDEM organizers for what seemed to be the start of a great conference
    (when I left early)
