Exactly two years ago on November 10th, 2011 I launched The Stack
 ([announcement here](/blog/2011/pushing-to-the-stack/)).

In theory, that should be 51/52 posts, but again I missed a few:

  * Week 49/2012 (weekend trip to Nuremberg)
  * Week 06/2013 (being sick)
  * Week 21/2013
  * Week 30/2013
  * Week 32/2013
  * Week 35/2013
  * Week 37/2013

7 missing (5 less than the year before), that leaves 44 posts - I could
 actually compete as an Iron Blogger ;) I have to work on writing down the
 reasons more diligently, though. Supposedly lack of time/planning/feeling
 like it - if you need one.

OK, so much for copy/pasting last year's post - original content ahead.

What I still haven't accomplished in this year is providing a page of all
 links, sorted by tag. I did write a script to have some insight into the
 number of tags and their distribution. I even corrected some of them, when
 they were close, but not identical (the old tagging problem...)

Here are the Top 10 categories:

  * 48x Clojure
  * 37x Python
  * 28x VIM
  * 24x Security
  * 22x Go
  * 21x Game Development
  * 20x PHP
  * 18x Web Development
  * 15x Fonts
  * 14x Algorithms


The only feedback I've gotten this year falls into three categories:

  * "I like it, please continue."
  * Sharing it on Twitter/Facebook, what I read as "I tentatively like it."
  * "Make it an email newsletter!11"

Thanks for #1 and #2 to the handful of readers :)

Yeah, thinking about #3, if I find a way to accomplish it without a lot of
 hassle, as I think I'll have less than 5 subscribers (the vocal minority).

If you got anything to add, feel free to contact me wherever you can get hold
 of me, that shouldn't be too hard.

I do have one wish for this project, I'd love to have more academic papers in
 it - obviously related to Computer Science, as that's all where I feel
 capable enough to understand them, maybe apart from very light mathematics -
 so if you find some, send me links. Of course other non-CS subjects might
 interest me as well. You can also send any sources where you find the papers
