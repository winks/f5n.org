I got thinking about the contents of my twitter timeline. There are a lot of advocacy and political topics in it lately. Sometimes from people who I followed for specific technical contents. And although I won't tell anyone to post or not post about anything, I seem to do it right now.

But I really don't want to read about certain topics on Twitter, as it's discouraging discussions. Well, maybe some people can do it, but I can't argue or even ask anything than very basic questions in 140 characters. You might call that rambling, but I can't argue in a totally succinct way. That's not to say I want anyone silenced, far from it. I do want to read about certain topics, but they're just too important for short quips.

So for me, Twitter really is broken if you can't argue by linking specs or benchmarks or any mostly technical stuff really. Even when there's a much clearer picture of wrong and right, I still find it annoying to discuss anything on Twitter, especially with more than 2 people involved.

Agreeing is surprisingly totally easy, just favorite it. Retweets are for the most part seen as positive promotion as well, unless directly followed upon with a statement of their own - but that happens only seldomly.
