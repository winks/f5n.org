Although I don't have any reliable numbers to back it up and I'm also not
expecting many visitors, it's said that more and more web traffic happens
from mobile devices and this website looked not too great on very small
screens (mobile phones, that is - tablet size should've been fine). One of
the reasons was that I had used a static grid via
[blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/) when I made the site and hadn't
changed anything since. The blueprint release I used in June 2011 was from May
2011, but that is still the latest release now and
although it had worked, I wasn't particularly impressed either.

So in the last two days I've redone the site in a responsive layout while
keeping the design (if you can call it so) mostly the same, except for some
intentional and unintentional changes to margins, paddings, font sizes and
whatnot.

[@ThorstenRinne](https://twitter.com/ThorstenRinne) recommended
[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) (v 4.3.1 as of now) and I'm quite
happy with it. My tests with a Desire Z, an LG C550 and an iPhone 5 showed
considerable progress, and that's about all the energy I can muster on this
project. Bugreports with screenshots are welcome, of course.

[The Stack](/stack/) will probably resume next monday, I've just been
too busy with stuff and didn't actually find a lot of interesting links either.
