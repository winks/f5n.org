These review posts have proven incredibly useful when looking up stuff this year, so I'll continue this (new-ish) tradition.

### Non-Board Games I've played/bought

  * WildStar - *not so much as last year, but I played it*
  * WoW - *I think I didn't do more than log in to a sub-20 character more than twice this year*
  * EVE Online - *if I played, it was early in the year, not so sure*
  * Marvel Heroes - *has completely destroyed Diablo as my go-to ARPG - spent a lot of hours here*
  * Guild Wars 2 - *my other go-to MMO in 2015*
  * Age of Wonders 3 - *couldn't resist a good deal, it's quite ok, but HoMM 3 is still better. Maybe HoMM 5 as well*
  * Assassin's Creed Brotherhood/Revelations/III/IV - *oh the Steam Sales. Started with Brotherhood, not completed. Ongoing procrastination project.*
  * Talisman: Digital Edition - *just not the same as playing the board game with friends, but it's ok I guess*
  * Realm of the Mad God - *nice for a quick run from time to time*
  * Mass Effect 1+2 - *Finally started with #1 after I got told it's really something everyone should've played. It's quite ok so far.*
  * Shadowrun: Dragonfall Director's Cut - *just as good, if not better, as Shadowrun Returns*
  * Shadowrun: Hong Kong - *still need to play this, high hopes it's just as good as its predecessors*
  * The Witcher 1+2 - *too cheap to pass on, same as with ME - but haven't started*
  * Borderlands 2 - *again on some recommendations - I liked it but haven't made it very far*
  * Lost Lands - *free to play hidden object game. First time I tried the genre, was quite nice to kill some time*


### Books I've read

Oh, that's a short one this year I guess. After my kindle was stolen in February and I was
commuting by bike all spring/summer/fall and also didn't really go on vacation at the beach...
I kinda didn't read a lot.

  * Vier Fäuste für ein blaues Auge: Wie der Wilde Westen nach Deutschland kam (Tommy Krappweis, Heinz J. Bründl) - *German book about a western-themed amusement park near Munich. Very funny if you knew it.*
  * [Burning Chrome](https://www.amazon.de/dp/0060539828) (William Gibson) - *short stories, including "Johnny Mnemonic" - awesome*
  * [Larklight](https://www.amazon.de/dp/1408800608/) (Philip Reeve) - *I think it's a childrens' book, but it has steampunk and it was enjoyable enough*
  * [Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks](https://www.amazon.de/dp/1941222153/) - *just as good as the first one*
  * *will amend if I stumble over more, but [LibraryThing](http://www.librarything.com/) tells me that was everything*


### The pile of shame - books I wanted to read

  * [Starcross](https://www.amazon.de/dp/1599901218/) (Philip Reeve) - *aka Larklight, part 2*
  * [Neil Gaiman - Coraline; The Graveyard Book; Fortunately, the Milk](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0062379828/)
  * [Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks](https://www.amazon.de/dp/1937785653)
  * *the two Foundation ones from last year's list*
  * *I bet I'll find some more*


### Movies I've watched

## TV Series I've (re)watched

  * The Prisoner - *still very cool*
  * Heroes S1 - *made my way through Season 1, and I think I fully enjoyed one episode - the last one. Then S02E01 was horrible and I stopped.*

### Comics I read

For the first time in many years I bought some comics. Usually the bigger books, not the thin magazines.

  * Ms Marvel (Wilson/Alphone) 1-2 - *very good, ordered Vol 3 already*
  * Punisher (Edmondson/Gerads) 1-2 - *very good, Vol 3 is sitting next to me*
  * She-Hulk (Soule/Pulido/Wemberly) 1 - *very good start, but I didn't like the change of the art style at all, so I stopped*
  * Web comics:
    * [Questionable Content](http://questionablecontent.net/)
    * [Alice Grove](http://www.alicegrove.com/)


### Social network usage

  * Twitter - *no change - regularly, not overly much, more reading and answering than writing*
  * Facebook - *no change - maybe a few more posts, regularly messaging with a few people*


### Messaging

  * IRC - *definitely more, although some channels went mostly dead*
  * Jabber - *very seldom, everyone seems to have moved on and I can't blame them*
  * Email - *same as usual*
  * Slack - *using it for work via their IRC bridge, but still have the browser open for the bonus things besides chat*


### Trips

  * Austria in September
  * [CfgMgmtCamp](http://www.cfgmgmtcamp.eu) and [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org) in Ghent/Brussels, Belgium, end of January
  * most of [Germany in August](/blog/2015/travel-road-trip/) including M'era Luna and CCCamp 2015


### Online services

  * Literally zero change compared to last year.


### Programming languages used, roughly in order of hours spent

  * Java - *work, not so bad*
  * Python - *work and a few private things, deployment and packaging is still hell*
  * Clojure - *fun projects like [multiplex](https://github.com/winks/multiplex) and a recruitment web app prototype I coded on a weekend*
  * PHP - *work, I'm quite indifferent right now*
  * Lua - *work, could've been more*
  * bash - *ugh, one day I'll write a sane-language-to-bash-converter tool ;)*
  * Rust - *so much to learn. toy project: [irc bot](https://github.com/winks/cerith)*
  * OCaml - *brief stint with the book at the start of the year, sadly too impractical for me right now - but I enjoyed it, unlike 2004 in university*


### Podcasts I listen to

So apparently the only tech podcasts I listen to are focused on stuff I have never used,
am not using, and don't plan to use. Still I enjoy listening to them talking about things.
Whereas when I tried some podcasts for stuff I am using and also interested in - I didn't like
the hosts' style. Only exception were most Rust podcasts I sampled, but it's too soon for a
real review, I guess.

  * [ATP](http://atp.fm/) - *I'm not using any Apple products and still listen to these guys.*
  * [Core Intuition](http://www.coreint.org/) - *Same thing applies, but at least more developer stuff.*
  * [Under the Radar](https://www.relay.fm/radar) - *And number three of the odd podcasts.*
  * [Battle Bards](http://battlebards.libsyn.com/) - *"A musical journey through MMO soundscapes"*
  * some real gaming podcasts, mostly talking about games I don't play
