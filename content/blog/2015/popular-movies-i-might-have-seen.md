This morning I stumbled upon [this fantastic post](http://www.marco.org/2015/04/11/popular-movies-i-havent-seen) by Marco Arment titled "Popular movies I haven’t seen in the last 15 years" where the first paragraph reads:

> Whenever anyone asks me about a popular movie, they’re flabbergasted that I haven’t seen it. You’d think they’d learn to just assume I’ve seen nothing, but they haven’t yet.

My first thought was something like "Wow, really? There have been a lot of good movies in the last 15 years." and although I've absolutely noticed that I'm watching less and less movies I was kind of shocked when I scrolled through the list and counted.

TLDR: I don't watch many mainstream movies. For the definition of mainstream that reads "Academy Award Best Picture nominees and top 10 highest-grossing films". So thanks Marco and I hope he doesn't mind that I copy his list verbatim.

**Key**: **Seen it**, Haven’t seen it

For the record: He has watched 33, I have 65 out of 234 (if I counted correctly). I find my numbers quite interesting, although misleading. If I subtract the 12 Marvel movies, 8 Harry Potter movies and 5 Tolkien movies, there goes a good third.
