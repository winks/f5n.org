Not a lot of personal coding this year, also skipped Advent of Code due to lack of time.

  * more pen & paper evenings, monthly Shadowrun has resumed

Happy this category is back. Concerts are back on the menu.

### Stuff I planned to do this year but didn't

  * no big vacation trip, the London thing was more of saving a thing that had gone wrong
  * visiting a bike park

### Stuff that would be nice next year

  * keep on cycling a lot, but do more mountain biking
  * bringing back board game night
