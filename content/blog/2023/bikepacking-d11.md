I'd long planned to do a multi day bikepacking
 [see footnote at the end] tour and these last few days in
my June vacation it finally happened. Planning wasn't so great, but it all
worked out in the end.

So the idea was to do the first part of the [D-Route 11][d11] in reverse.
This is an official long-distance cycling route from the
[Baltic Sea to Upper Bavaria][d11de], but my plan was to start in Freilassing,
next to the Austrian border and go as far as I have time.


## Planning

One huge problem was that I got some sort of flu three weeks before starting
and basically spent two weeks in bed, from a "how am I feeling every day?"
point of view it was even worse than when I had Covid and then I did a 
city trip just before this, that also meant no time for preparation.

At first I planned to do some camping on the way but then in the end decided
to just use hotels as this was the first multi-day trip and maybe a bed and a
shower were amenities I could use, also the Decathlon tent I was eying (the
only one at around 1kg, the Forclaz Trek MT900) would have cost me around
170 EUR anyway. I used Booking.com for all my hotel research and booking.

So, in the end I settled on a 5 day trip and staying on the route as much as
possible.

While [this page][radroutenplaner] has the complete GPX track, the overall
presentation is kinda horrible, so I mostly used [this page, in German][wga],
because I could download the single day partial tracks and it has some data
on altitude change etc.

The plan was:

  * go to Freilassing by train from Munich
  * day 1, Freilassing to Rosenheim, 95km
  * day 2, Rosenheim to Munich, 63km
  * day 3, Munich to Landshut, 78km
  * day 4, Landshut to Kelheim, 78km
  * day 5, Kelheim to Hilpoltstein, 99km
  * continue to Weißenburg, where we had booked a vacation home
  * some days later, go home by train again

## Preparations

I'd been hemming and hawing about getting a Gravel Bike for a while but only
did some window shopping and didn't really want to spend 2000 EUR on a new
bike, but luckily [Pascal](https://pascal.jungblut.me/) wanted to get rid
of his old one anyway and after some scheduling problems we managed to let
me test it on the day before I was supposed to leave and it felt good and
so I was able to take it along that day. Which reminds me that I still 
need to pay. Oops. (Wrote most of this on the weekend
and have since paid for it :P)

I also went to the local big bike shop for some last minute stuff: a top tube
bag, 2 bottle holders, a chain tool, maybe some good Ortlieb or Vaude panniers.

In the end I bought a cheap top tube bag, 2 bottle holders, fingerless gloves,
a gel for emergencies, some power bars, a chain tool, and no panniers.

I was packing extra light, one of the reasons was that I was going to be home
at the end of day 2 and be able to grab stuff I was missing. I didn't grab
anything except refilling my bottles and bars, just as I would have somewhere
else, which was nice. Packing list below.


## Day 0

As usual, Deutsche Bahn let me down by not letting me book my ticket one day
in advance. The search form on the website let me filter by available bike
space on a train, to only tell me then that the available Railjets to Salzburg
were not available after all, and the regional trains would not let me book a
ticket for the bike, at all. So getting up early it was. In hindsight I am
still a little confused why you can't buy a bicycle day ticket for the next
day (or at all?) online, you can buy one for the next day at the ticket
machine.


## Day 1 - Freilassing - Rosenheim

Got up at around 4:30, final preparations, cycled to the central station, got
there at around 5:15, grabbed a ticket for me and for my bike, took the train
to Freilassing at 5:55 and had a nice chat with two other bike travellers.

Got off at 7:45 and started my way towards Rosenheim, only stopping for a
second breakfast in Traunstein and made it to Chiemsee around noon but did not
really have any luck finding a restaurant I liked, so had a Currywurst with
fries at Döner-Kebap-Haus in Bernau. As this was the first day and it was hot
and I hadn't really ridden a bike a lot the last weeks I crashed pretty hard
around 3-4 in the afternoon and was looking for a shop or gas station to get
something cold to drink, but nothing was open in any vicinity of my route.
At some point I decided to veer off my route and try to get to that one
grocery store that Google Maps showed as open in a somewhat close village and
that was the first and only time I had to get off the bike and walk, uphill.
Of course Maps was wrong and the store only had been open until noon but there
was a restaurent next to it and so I ordered two drinks and rested for half an
hour, then could continue my journey for the last 90 or so minutes. Hotel was
a bit of a letdown, had to wait 15 minutes for someone at the reception to
arrive (while hardly being able to stand anymore after 10h on the bike, minus
breaks), room wasn't great or overly clean and the couple that arrived
just after me didn't get their booked room and got an address for an apartment.
I suppose they'd been
given my room if I had been 15 minutes late and on any other day I'd happily
tried to sort something out but I was just so glad to be able to take a shower.
They were back the next morning when I went for breakfast so maybe the did get
my room after all as they seemed to be staying for longer. Also the guy at the
reception made me pay via card and one day later booking.com also charged via
PayPal, so I had to sort that out later, but didn't take too long to fix.
Went to an Italian restaurant (Da Giuliano)
around a kilometer from the Hotel, adjacent to
some sports club and had some excellent pizza and a very noisy and
annoying neighboring table.

In hindsight I noticed that I hardly slept the night before. Stressed out
because of the train, a bit overexcited and because I hadn't anticipated that
I wouldn't really sleep I went to bed too late (or I had had 2h more of trying
to sleep) - maybe the day would have been easier if I had been well-rested.

Daily kilometers: 109

Total kilometers: 109

## Day 2 - Rosenheim - Munich

Wasn't looking forward too much to this route, as I had gone the opposite way
already last September (Munich to Rosenheim, then to Wasserburg and home by
train) but it's part of the route. First you go along the river Mangfall past
Kolbermoor, then Bad Aibling and Bruckmühl until
Feldkirchen and then you're already close enough to Munich that there's an
S-Bahn station nearby. Had lunch at the Ayinger Bräustüberl around 12:30 and
then was routed through a part of Munich I hardly knew so that was interesting
as well. Arrived home at around 16:00, and spent the evening recovering and
doing some things I'd not gotten to, like preparing the route for the next
three days...

Surprisingly my legs were completely ok, but my shoulders hurt a lot at the
end of day 2, I guess that's because of the new bike, new position with the
different cockpit, and just cycling for so many hours. Also the route turned
out to be slightly different than the one I used last year, so overall a good
day still.

Also I noticed that one of clamps on my cheap bike panniers had broken, so I
decided to use the other one from the set for the second part. Other than that,
nothing had failed or misbehaved.

Daily kilometers: 78

Total kilometers: 187

## Day 3 - Munich - Landshut

The first leg of this tour was again something I'd seen, along the Isar
towards Freising is a trip I've done several times wholly or partially on my
hardtail as a day trip. That day I learned the difference that a front
suspension makes on certain types of gravel, ouch. The trip was uneventful,
except for struggling to find a place for lunch again, in the end I settled on
"Gasthaus und Hotel Forster am See" in Eching, mostly because I was riding
past at 13:00, had mediocre Käsespätzle with a good salad. And a light shower
that made me switch tables, good timing though. Apparently this leg was a
bit short because I arrived at the hotel at around 15:00. The hotel was in
Ergolding, not Landshut proper, so just a bit past it, from my starting point.

This was some "no reception, check in at an ATM" thing that mostly seemed to
house construction workers, but it was cheap and seemed ok. Only downside was
not having an elevator and my room on the 2nd floor. Not a huge problem but
when I arrived I would have used it.

I wanted a burger for dinner, but couldn't find any place that looked decent
and I kinda felt fresh (and cocky) enough so I decided to add a little
detour to Wörth an der Isar after an hour long break at the hotel, that would
be another 15km to get there and 15 to get back. When I arrived in Wörth I
checked Maps again and saw a place where someone had posted a photo of a
burger, so I went there (La Dolce Vita, again next to a sports club) and
the burger was excellent (although I've been told everything tastes better
after 100km a day). Got a scoop of ice cream on the way back and went to bed
early, as usual. While I usually like riding along the Isar (on my hardtail),
for this long trip, and day 3, it was a bit boring at times.

Daily kilometers: 113

Total kilometers: 300

## Day 4 - Landshut - Kelheim

This leg had me go through Ergoldsbach, Neufahrn in Niederbayern, Pfeffendorf,
and Schaltdorf and again I wasn't sure where I would get lunch or whether I'd
find something at all. Luckily I found "Bei Mario" in Rohr in Niederbayern
and had a really good pizza and even got my Espresso for free and my water
bottles refilled. Thank you, Mario!

Onwards to Sallingberg, Offenstetten, Abensberg and Saal an der Donau, where
I had my second ice cream of the trip in a weird cafe, but it tasted good
enough. Saal would have been the official end of the leg, but I continued to
Kelheim (where my hotel was) along the route.

This was the second "check in via machine" hotel without a reception and every
step of the process seemed to take ages and in the end it errored out, but
luckily still printed my room code. Apartment was huge and cheap for the size,
but the bed wasn't great. Also got an email later that the processing had
failed although the printed recipe showed me paying so something I needed
to sort out when I was back. It's been resolved meanwhile and they were very
polite about it.

Research for dinner yielded "Little Budapest" which sounded nice, where I had
some kinda good Hungarian beer (Soproni) and a tasty and spicy meal.

The worst thing about the hotel was that the power outlets next to the bed
were unreasonably high up the wall so when I plugged in my phone at night I
broke my charging cable (still mostly my fault) and had no backup. Luckily
I'd already done some research for the next day but was still panicking a bit.
At least it had happened on a Sunday evening with shops open the next day, the
problem would just be to find one.

Daily kilometers: 82

Total kilometers: 382

## Day 5 - Kelheim - Hilpoltstein

This leg was supposed to be a long one, first along the river Altmühl.
So getting up very early was a fun challenge with a switched off phone, but I
just hoped I'd wake up at some point during the early morning hours and then be
able to switch on my GPS and set an alarm. That worked, but I still ended up
waking up at 6:15 just before the alarm. Grabbed my stuff to stand ready at
6:50 when the bug grocery store opened, but unfortunately they didn't have any
charging cables and the electronics store wouldn't open until 9.

Anyway, no use delaying and so the route went to Essing, Prunn and in
Riedenburg I saw a sign for a store that sounded like it was worth a shot,
unfortunately it was way up a hill, so I decided to walk. They were open and
very nice, but unfortunately they only had lamps and washing machines and TV
cables, but no USB ones, but referred me to an electronics store in Dietfurt
(or the one in Kelheim where I came from). So off to Dietfurt along my planned
route, and there I first stopped at another big grocery store, mostly to get
a drink but they actually had USB-C cables and I didn't need to search for the
electronics store, yay. Hooked up my phone to my power bank and continued to
Beilngries, Kinding and Greding, where most restaurant were closed and I had
to take the open one with the worst ratings, but the waitress was nice and let
me charge my phone inside, and the food was actually ok as well. Just after
lunch I arrived in Thalmässing, the last bigger town before the planned end of
the leg, Hilpoltstein.

Here I was to decide if I'd stop the D-11 route and go straight to the
vacation home or finish the leg and go from there. As it was kinda early in
the day, I felt reasonably fresh and able I decided to push to the end.
There is supposed to be a somewhat easy way between the two towns and there
was the route on my GPS which was kinda brutal, those last 20km really took a
while and it was the first time where I pushed the bike up a 15% hill, as part
of the originally planned route (the other two were when I had left the route
to detour to a shop), but in the end made it to Hilpoltstein where I planned
to sit in a cafe and have some coffee and a slice of cake maybe, but in the
end I sat in the shade in the REWE parking lot, chugging drinks, refilling my
bottles and making the cashier look at me funny when I came in back to buy 2
more bottles just after I'd left buying 4 bottles.

After that I took on the last 30km of the tour and made it to Weißenburg, only
to be defeated by the vacation home being on a hill that I did not have the
energy to pedal up, after 125km that day.

Anyway, got some decent dinner and that was the first bikepacking trip.

Five days, just a bit more than 500km, four of our seven Bavarian governmental
districts, and 5 of 22 legs of the whole D-11 route done.

Not sure if it will work out, but I'd love to continue where I left off
later this year, maybe doing 3-4 days over a long weekend, which would be just
past the Bavarian border, with the day trips I chose.

Daily kilometers: 127

## Packing list

**Attached to the bike**:

  * GPS, Garmin eTrex 20x
  * one old gym bottle with 50% Fanta, 50% water or just water
  * one bottle of Gatorade or Fanta

**Worn**:

  * Helmet
  * Sunglasses
  * Five Ten MTB shoes
  * Fingerless padded gloves
  * Jersey
  * padded bib shorts
  * MTB shorts (no, I'm not that spandex guy)
  * normal socks

**Backpack** (Deuter Race X 12L with 3L water bladder):

  * spare AA batteries for the GPS
  * bike lock
  * keys (lock + home)
  * wallet
  * power bank
  * Buff neck scarf thingy (U)
  * cloth handkerchief (U, Z)
  * pack of handkerchiefs
  * Hand disinfectant (U, Y)
  * wet wipes (U, X)
  * plastic spoon (U)
  * Foldable shopping bag (U)
  * glasses case (U, Y)
  * bike tools
  * pump (U)
  * spare tube (U)
  * sunblocker
  * meds, bandaids, magnesium pills

**Pannier** (a cheap "bikemate" one from Aldi, old and never used before):

  * Jersey
  * padded bib shorts
  * MTB shorts
  * one pair of socks
  * rain jacket
  * toothbrush, toothpaste, shower gel
  * thin long-sleeve hoodie (U)
  * t-shirt
  * boxers
  * normal pants
  * wall plug for charging
  * small pouch with: (U)
    * sewing kit
    * ear plugs
    * 2 small carabiners and some zip ties and rubber bands

So, basically a 2nd set of what I wear cycling,
plus t-shirt + underwear + pants for going
out for dinner. The stuff I wore every day (minus the MTB shorts) I rinsed
under the shower, then packed into a towel and rolled it, then patted it dry
and let it dry in the hotel room over night.
Works fine with synthetic fibres and just
barely with normal socks, not with a cotton t-shirt for example.
I could have avoided the normal pair of pants (some hiking ones with
detachable legs at the knee) and just used the pair of shorts I hadn't used
that day but it wasn't a huge deal either way. I did use them most days though.


**Makeshift army shop pouch used as a handlebar bag**:

  * wind breaker jacket (U)
  * quick snap ultralight unsafe-ish bike lock (U)
  * extra elastic strap (U)
  * in-ear headphones (U)

**Top tube bag**:

  * energy bars
  * energy gel (U)
  * dextrose candies
  * gummy bears
  * phone unless it was in my pants pocket

So while the list is pretty long I didn't use a lot of space.

I am reasonably sure my backpack is the 12l model and the pannier is around
13l, going from the dimensions. The extra pouch I had is maybe 1l, so is the
top frame bag. So all in all I guess it's just below 30l, aka one of the
bigger panniers by the usual suspects.

Some explanation of the footnotes:

  * **U** - Unused
  * **X** - Expired, should've checked
  * **Y** - In hindsight I should have left those at home

In total I am quite happy with my choices. Nearly all the things I brought and
did not use fell under the "emergency" category and nearly all of them were
pretty lightweight (handkerchief, 1 gel, wind breaker, straps and bands) or
so important that weight didn't matter too much (spare tube, pump, tools, rain
jacket).

I usually bring a hard case for my glasses, but I guess as I was only having my
old beaten up sunglasses I could have saved that. Also the hand sanitizer...
where I went to eat I could usually wash my hands, or still had them clean
from the hotel room when buying breakfast. Not totally useless I guess as I
never had to make a toilet break during the day once (yay sweat). And my wet
wipes were completely dry after many years in my bag,
need to double check that next time.

The quick-snap lock I had bought for a couple of euros a while ago seems a
little useless, I'd imagined it as some "I need to fix the bike to a pole or
railing in a few seconds while having to step away really quickly, and no time
to take out the lock from my back pack", but that never happened. But I guess
it's like 50g (like a zip tie with a metal core, with a special plain key) so
not much lost, except those couple euros :P

The weather was really nice so I didn't need to change on a whim.

The list of things I should have taken and did not is pretty short:

  * second USB charging cable (it broke, and it's small and light)
  * wound disinfectant spray (scratched my leg at some point)

I pondered about taking a lightweight pair of shoes but that seemed very much
not needed, as I was wearing "normal" MTB shoes without cleats.

## Expenses

  * Preparation:
    * a new (used) bike :P
    * some 100 EUR of missing bike equipment (tools, tubes, gloves, bags)
  * Hotels:
    * Rosenheim: 80 EUR
    * at home: free :D
    * Landshut (easy sleep Apartmenthotel): 61 EUR
    * Kelheim (greenpartment Boardinghousehotel): 80 EUR
  * Trains:
    * Bike: 2x 6 EUR
    * Munich to Freilassing: 34 EUR but I don't know why, should be 27 EUR
    * Treuchtlingen to Dachau: 24 EUR
  * Stuff:
    * USB charging cable: 7 EUR

Food is hard to gauge as I didn't really pay attention here. I usually had
lunch and dinner, meals ranged from 8 to 16 EUR, usually with one or two
drinks on top - but I usually did choose a cheaper menu option.
Breakfast was usually from a bakery, only on day one I had a
"proper" one in a cafe for 8 EUR. Then 2-3 coffees, a scoop of ice cream here
and there and a lot of
mostly half litre bottles of Fanta/Water/Gatorade in supermarkets, so not that
bad - only on Sunday I needed to stop at a gas station twice and paid a
premium.

But I did avoid having to buy panniers or anything really costly just for
this trip, as my bike clothes and equipment were in solid shape.
I guess by not paying for a single room but a double for two people
you can cut costs, the next thing would be to only
have dinner at a restaurant and take some stuff with you for lunch. I planned
to stop at McDonalds once but it didn't work out with the route. Can't beat
the cost/kcal ratio there I guess, but I don't think I wasted a lot of money.


## Final thoughts

Very fun, would do it again any time. Needs a bit of prep work and a proper
bike. I could have used my hardtail, but without any panniers it might have
been hard to put all the stuff in. Many people prefer to go without a
backpack, but mine is fine for me as long as I don't make it too heavy.
The suggested 80-100 km per day seem ok for someone who usually uses a bike
a lot but hasn't really started the season with doing longer trips.
A day with up to 800m of climbing was mostly doable, the day with 1800
was hard. My stop at home in the middle was
a nice safety net, but completely unneeded, although I did of course plan
around it a bit, for example only taking one spare tube for the first two
days and not two of them, or less energy bars, and brought breakfast with me
when leaving for the second time.

I also guess I was overly cautious and now I know better how much I can
manage to do in one day. I was not skipping a meal, I was not only drinking
water - I guess you can wing it a lot more.

Regarding camping with a tent, that would absolutely mean taking a second
pannier and as you're not allowed to camp out in the wild in Germany I tried
to do a little research regarding camping sites but their websites are mostly
terrible and I wasn't confident I'd have a place to sleep every night. Guess I
should try that some other time when it's not a huge trip, just a weekend
where if bad comes to worst you can improvise.

## Footnotes

1) I know some people might take offense that by sleeping in hotels and not
in a tent it's not bikepacking, but bicycle touring but I honestly don't care.
I did plan to go with a tent but it didn't work out. Maybe next time.
