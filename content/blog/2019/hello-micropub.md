As I wrote [2 weeks ago](/blog/2019/looking-at-micropub/) I've been looking into
Micropub and after some tests and deciding that not everything needs to work out
of the box I decided to use this half-baked plan and roll with it.

  * [skpy/micropub](https://github.com/skpy/micropub) works
  * [skpy/hugo-themes][skpyhugo] hope it's OK to steal template snippets ;)
  * those need a newer [hugo][gohugo] version, so I updated from 0.13 to 0.59.1

So I still need to properly link to the [2019/11][notes201911] current "notes",
but it seems to work.
