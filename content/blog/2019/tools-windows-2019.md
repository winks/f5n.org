Despite never speaking very highly of it, Windows is still the OS of choice for
my main machine at home, because it's mostly used for gaming and I still find
it highly annoying to work on Windows.

I've written about what software I use in [2014][win2014] and [2016][win2016]
and now, with the [new computer][hw2019] and using Windows 10 for the first
time, it makes sense to update the list.

I guess the overarching theme is that I need less specialized stuff as I have
completely moved development off this platform.

  * Browsers:
    * `Firefox` and `Firefox Developer`, only because the taskbar stacking/pinning
      makes it really annoying to *just* use two profiles at the same time
  * E-Mail
    * `Thunderbird` for the main account
    * `SylpheedPortable` for testing stuff
  * IRC
    * `Quassel`
  * Audio/Video
    * `foobar2000` for mp3s
    * `VLC` for Videos
    * `Greenshot` for screenshots
    * `IrfanView` for images, but it's a bit weird on Win10 so far
  * Editors
    * `Notepad++` for everything that's not code
  * Voice
    * `Discord`
  * Passwords and encryption
    * `KeePassXC`
    * `VeraCrypt`
  * Networking stuff
    * `PuTTY`
    * `FileZillaPortable`
  * Misc
    * `CopyQ` for clipboard management
    * `SharpKeys` to rebind CapsLock to F9
    * `WinSplit Revolution` for window tiling
    * `7ZipPortable`
    * `Launchy` because Linux has spoiled me for launchers
  * Game Launchers
    * `Steam`
    * `Epic Games`
    * `GoG Galaxy`
    * `Twitch` for free stuff and WoW addons

Then some things I have put off installing for now:

  * `Visual Studio Code` when I really, really need to develop on this machine
  * `f.lux`
  * `MP3Tag`
  * `VirtualBox`
  * `SumatraPDF`
  * `cmder`
  * `Audacity`
  * `Spotify`
  * `JuicePortable` (writing my own replacement)

And stuff that I left out and don't plan on using in the near future:

  * any jabber client
  * `Chrome`
  * `CDEx` (no drive anymore)
  * `InfraRecorder`

So overall I still think that list is too long, but on the other hand compared
to the old lists and the dozens of small tools I had installed these are kind of
the essentials.
