### Podcasts I listen to

Very irregular this year:

  * [Battle Bards](http://battlebards.libsyn.com/) - *"A musical journey through MMO soundscapes"*
  * [ATP](http://atp.fm/) - *I'm not using any Apple products and still listen to these guys sometimes.*
  * some real gaming podcasts, but even less regularly

These keep getting shorter and shorter, maybe the focus on media consumed and used for
communication is not the right angle anymore.
