[dockermail]: https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver


### Programming languages used, roughly in order of hours spent

  * C++ - *work, I like it a lot more than I had thought*
  * bash - *still too much*
  * Python - *work and a few private things, deployment and packaging is still hell*
  * PHP - *for one private project*
  * Rust - *still learning*
  * [several for AoC](/blog/2019/advent-of-code-2019/)


### Podcasts I listen to

Very irregular this year:

  * [Battle Bards](http://battlebards.libsyn.com/) - *"A musical journey through MMO soundscapes"*
  * [ATP](http://atp.fm/) - *I'm not using any Apple products and still listen to these guys sometimes.*
  * some real gaming podcasts, but even less regularly


### Stuff that kinda worked out

  * write more blog posts: 7 isn't a lot, but it's ok, also wrote elsewhere
  * get my self-hosted services in shape, trimming unneeded, keep everything updated, etc
  * <s>learn</s> try out some new programming language(s)
  * after 2 years I'm no expert in C++, but I can work just fine with it


### Stuff I planned to do this year but didn't

  * start properly learning Spanish
  * write a replacement for my podcast downloader of choice (JuicePortable), because it stopped working
  * solve the [deployment problem of hobby projects](https://lobste.rs/s/xh5b5n/how_do_you_deploy_your_hobby_web_projects)
  * add Micropub support for this site. [Started](/blog/2019/looking-at-micropub/) but didn't finish.
  * do more Rust
  * do more Clojure


### "New Year's Resolutions" aka stuff that would be nice if it would work out

  * be able to read cyrillic letters fluently and practice enough to memorize them
  * learning from AoC: focus on one or two languages for hobby stuff and get good with it, not just be able to use it and forget stuff all the time
  * read at least 3 novels this year (starting slow, somehow I lost the enjoyment of reading. Literally lost it, my shelves are full with books I read.)
  * get my podcast management thing to at least a usable state


These lists keep getting shorter and shorter, maybe the focus on media consumed and used for
communication is not the right angle anymore.
