I had this list halfway finished, when I actually took a look at the
 [2014 list](/blog/2014/tools-windows) and to my surprise I
 a) wrote it basically 2 years ago and
 b) hardly anything has changed.

So I'll start with the changes:

  * Browsers:
    * no more `IronPortable` for Facebook, but a dedicated profile and `-no-remote`
  * Audio/Video:
    * haven't used `Mp3Tag` in ages
  * Editors:
    * I never fully warmed up with `LightTable`
    * still unimpressed with `Atom`
    * used `Visual Studio Code` for some Rust stuff, it's cool
    * not using `eclipse` for much these days
    * `gVim` for special tasks that Notepad2 can't do
  * Jabber:
    * `Gajim` (like on Linux) instead of `PidginPortable`
  * Misc:
    * `SyncThing` on my NAS instead of `BTSync`
  * Programming stuff:
    * `leiningen`, `Rust` and Github's `git` cli client (hardly ever the GUI)
  * `PortableApps`:
    * Didn't need `Audacity` in the last 2 years I guess
  * Random stuff:
    * Been using VirtualBox more for work stuff (when working from home)
    * [`Gow`](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow) seems cool, but I don't really need it on Windows when a linux is just a putty away
    * Started using `Launchy` again

And here are the newcomers:

  * `Spotify` - Free user, listening to an album once in a while when I might buy it
  * `Wordpress.com` - Surprisingly handy if you post to a blog on wordpress.com
  * `cmder` - Finally a proper terminal, although ConEmu isn't too bad either
  * `Discord` - Tried it out for a while, but no community where I feel I belong to, so on hiatus again
  * `Juice` - downloading and keeping track of Podcasts (JuicePortable)
  * `PicPick` - awesome screenshot tool (PicPickPortable)

And some stuff I hadn't mentioned last time:

  * `KVIrc` - when testing irc stuff, used to my default client before Quassel (KVIrcPortable)
  * `Pidgin` - also for testing, jabber stuff (PidginPortable)
  * `Skype` - had to use it twice this year already...
  * `Notepad2_lua` - Notepad2 version with a Lua lexer, should be replaced if I found something proper and small and wrote more Lua

The wishlist:

  * Something to *really* quickly share screenshots (and files) - picpick (or copying file) + syncthing is nice, but not perfect
  * A bigger 2nd screen, IRC really does take up some space

Pinned items on my task bar (which is on the top of the second, smaller, monitor):

  * `Chrome`
  * `Firefox`
  * `Explorer`
  * `Quassel`
  * `Thunderbird`
  * `foobar2000`
  * `Notepad2`
  * `PuTTY`
  * `TweetDeck`
  * `Steam`

Everything not under changes above is still the same as in the [2014 list](/blog/2014/tools-windows). How unexciting.
