In [2023](/blog/2023/bikepacking-d11/) I started cycling along the
[D11][d11] ([Ostsee-Oberbayern-Radweg][d11de]) across Germany, 500km on that
trip, then 300km [in 2024](/blog/2024/d11-part-two/).

[d11]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Cycling_Network
[d11de]: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostsee%E2%80%93Oberbayern_(D11)

This is part 3, four days and 430km.

## Planning

The route was clear (duh), but not the stops. This time I wanted to push
myself a bit, but I also had to take into account the availability of
hotels and the price, otherwise I might have cut down the route a little
bit.

What I decided on:

  * Hof to Kaulsbach (close to Saalfeld): 113km
  * Kaulsbach to Freyburg: 123km
  * Freyburg to Alsleben: 115km
  * Alsleben to Dessau: 80km (with an optional detour of 30km)

## Preparations

I didn't need a lot of new gear, but I wanted new rain pants, as my 10 or more
like likely 12 or 13y old pair was already disintegrating, so I grabbed a pair
for 60 EUR at Lucky Bike and saw a black jersey on the discount pile for 40
EUR, and it was the matching one to my black MTB shorts (also Endura), so I
bought that as well.

My trusty Garmin eTrex that I'd bought in 2016 for 170 EUR had lost its power
button on a recent hiking trip. Probably not unfixable but I'd already wanted
to get a newer, proper cycling GPS for a while, so after some research I
went with the Edge 840 because I'd been happy with Garmin devices in the past.
The eTrex and also the car navi was fine. I ended up paying 390 EUR for it.

The irony of probably paying more for this thing than for any 
[mobile phone/tablet](/blog/2023/mobile-phones/) I have ever owned is not
lost on me. But in my defense I'm not that worried about security and plan
to keep using it for 8-10 years if it holds up, just like the last one.



## Day 1 - Hof - Kaulsbach

My train to Hof was scheduled for 5:44 and I need 30 minutes of (slow) riding
to the train station, so I got up at around 4:15 with most things already
packed and went on my merry way, forgetting I'll be passing one club with
many drunk people and glass on the street at 5 am, as usually.

The train arrived on time at 9:20, then I noticed that I should have spent a
little more time famliarizing myself with the Garmin Edge, so I took a little
detour because I messed up, still in Hof.

At some point I passed into Thuringia, but I don't remember seeing a sign.

As it was Father's Day I saw a lot of groups (mostly men, but not only)
hiking, walking, drinking beer, cycling and to my surprise I was cheered
on quite a few times when they noticed I'm the only idiot on this route
without an e-bike.

Speaking of the route... too much elevation, too many small hills and
mountains. Had to push the bike a couple times. In total around 1600m
of ascent, but the scenery was mostly nice.

I had some Thüringer Rostbratwurst and a Coke for lunch, not even completely
sure where it was, in a small village, my best guess is Saaldorf.

The [hotel I chose][grueneeiche] was pretty nice, could bring the bike in to
the closed off courtyard and they had something to lock it to the wall.

Dinner in their restaurant was also very good (Soljanka and Wiener Schnitzel).

For some reason I couldn't really fall asleep, despite that very tedious
day, but I think I still got 8h in the end.

Breakfast was also really good here.

## Day 2 - Kaulsbach - Freyburg

Because of the breakfast and being slow to pack up again I only started at
around 9 am and hit another climb just 1km into my tour, that's when I
decided to push the bike a little more.

I think it was on this day (but not 100% sure) when a lady flagged me down
in the middle of the forest because she had a flat on her e-bike. I tried to
help and pump it up but I guess it was proper done for, so she had to continue
pushing the bike for a km or so, but seemed relatively unfazed. Maybe I could
have tried to make my spare tube fit and replace it but with 100km ahead I
wasn't too enthusiastic about it so I didn't suggest it.

At some point I passed into Saxony-Anhalt, but again I didn't see any sign.


Originally I wanted to stay in Naumburg, but for some reason (on this day I
think it was the price) I chose to cycle another 7km or so to the north and
stay in Freyburg.

The room was decent, the bathroom was a little small for someone my size,
but overall ok. Could bring the bike into the entry hall of the building.

Went to [Haveli][https://haveli-freyburg.net/], an Indian Restaurant, for
dinner, quite a big portion of Chicken Tikka Masala and some Naan, and
pretty good.


## Day 3 - Freyburg - Alsleben

The weather was good, but I had to backtrack 7-8km to the south, and
went through Naumburg, where I had incorporated a couple photo spots into
my route, then to Weißenfels and Leuna, then coming to Merseburg, where
again I had changed the route slightly to take a detour into the city
proper.

Because this was going to be another long day, but with less elevation and
thus more time, I decided to have a proper lunch for once, so I chose the
best-rated pizza place and was very disappointed. Waiter wasn't sure what
to make of my order of a Pizza Prosciutto because they only had a Prosciutto
e Funghi or a Hawaii but after explaining which word is the Prosciutto and
which word is (are?) the Funghi, at least that part worked out. It didn't
taste great though and I'm not sure when I ever left the outer part of a
pizza... ah well.

On to Halle and mostly ignoring it because I've been here already a couple
of years ago and further north through Könnern, to Alsleben (and still
following the river Saale).

Grabbed dinner at a small pension/restaurant in the town center and talked
to the only other guest at the next table, also a cycling tourist. A welcome
surprise, apparently I'm not good with chatting up other cyclists on my
tours normally.

Because my shoulder had started to hurt the day before I had picked up
some stuff from a drugstore in the morning, as it was Saturday and they
were still open.

Either I hadn't read the booking page carefully or they were not very obvious
with their offering, but I was a little surprised to find a communal shower
(and toilet) next to the small log hut I'd booked. Not a problem, really - but
they had failed to mention that showering was to be paid with 1 EUR coins and
even the toilet was locked behind 20ct coins, but it was open when I arrived,
or I would have asked. Also apparently the last renters had taken the only
set of keys with them and they would be mailed back in the future... so
I had no keys to my room, but I wasn't too worried about that, being on a
property, behind another house and a fence. And they had no curtains so the
sun woke me up at 5:30...

But at least it was cheap, and it actually looked as nice as on the pictures,
and I could sit on my own porch and look out on the river in the evening.

## Day 4 - Alsleben - Dessau

Although I'd slept quite well, it was pouring in the morning and I wasn't
actually enthusiastic about another 100km, I opted to skip my optional detour
to Aschersleben, which would have added around 30km, and I felt 80 was gonna be
enough for that day.

I think I liked this day less than the others, mostly because there were lots
of boring stretches with no features, sometimes along bigger roads, less
kilometers through forests or along rivers. Not bad, but just not as exciting.

Also this was the first day where my bum hurt, and my shoulder also hurt
again.



So because my bus was going to go at 1:50 in the night, arrive 15min from home
at around 7:15 and I was scheduled to be online at 8:00 to be on-call for the
week at work and not completely optimistic to be sleeping well or at all on
the bus I opted to take a cheap hotel room in Leipzig and try to sleep from
around 8pm to 1 am, which surprisingly mostly worked. 40 EUR well spent.
Also [the room](https://www.booking.com/hotel/de/gwuni-mopera.html) was
actually pretty nice, not even taking the price into account.

At first I had planned to maybe take a bed in a hostel for 15 EUR, but for
this case where the only things I wanted were a shower and silence for a
couple of hours and not having to care about the bike or getting a towel or
whatever... I guess the 20-25 EUR was an ok tradeoff.

The bus thing worked out surprisingly fine, and I could actually sleep a
couple hours more, so I didn't feel too bad in the morning and also didn't
have to instantly jump in the shower again.

The bike was hella dirty though after 5h on the back of a bus.


Oh, and here's the GPX result in comparison to the route above:

  * same bike, KTM X-Strada
  * same handle bar, frame, and top tube bag
  * same backpack

  * more rain/cold weather gear overall
  * backup wall plug and cable
  * banana!
  * less sweets, no gels, just some store-bought bars

## Final thoughts

It was fun, but I underestimated the elevation on day 1. Day 2 should have
been a bit more relaxing but still quite a few kilometers, and I guess that's
why I ended up cutting day 4 a bit short. A rough estimation tells me that
I have about 550km left to reach the Baltic Sea now. I hope to complete this
in 2026 and not have to split it into two parts, but we'll see. Getting to the
start and getting back is becoming increasingly annoying. The way back in 2023
was only about 2:20h by train, getting to the start was already 3:30h this
time, and getting back was 5:30h on a bus.

Having the new Garmin and connecting it to the phone was really great, I used
[brouter](https://brouter.de) and [gpx.studio](https://gpx.studio) for on the
fly checking and planning my routes when having breaks and in the evening.
