So I got my first Mac (MBP 16") in October 2024 and I've been using it for
work (and Advent of Code) and nothing else for nearly 7 months now.

Time for a recap.

  * annoyances I have fixed:
    * writing German umlauts with `AltGr-u + u` = ü
    * caps lock does nothing bad
    * aligning windows (usually just 50:50 splits) with Rectangle
  * annoyances I have not fixed:
    * full keyboard control with KeyboardMaestro
    * being able to use capslock as a hyper key
    * activating one Firefox window via Cmd-Tab not activating all Firefox windows
    * the mac's builtin keyboard printing `§ ±` instead of ` <backtick> ~` on the tilde key
  * most important apps:
    * Firefox
    * Strongbox (aka KeePass files)
    * Rectangle (for tiling)
    * Ukulele (for keybinds)
    * Cog
  * apps for work:
    * IntelliJ
    * Teams
    * Slack
    * Safari (or any second browser to log in to some internal stuff)
    * Podman Desktop (basically just for testcontainers, no real interactive use here)
    * GitUp (but I somehow prefer `tig` and the IntelliJ git history viewer)
    * Citrix Workspace
    * VisualVM
    * Bruno
  * nice to have:
    * Hammerspoon
    * CopyClip
    * Syncthing
    * TextAdept (or any editor for notes with certain features)
    * WezTerm (default terminal is fine though)
    * QuasselClient
    * VLC
  * homebrew
    * ripgrep
    * fzf
    * htop
    * lua
    * neovim
    * pinentry-mac

I have admin privileges on my machine, but it's still managed somehow, so the
only thing I can't do is add kernel extensions, in my case this would be
KeyboardMaestro and Tailscale. One is very annoying, one doesn't matter. 

That's a pretty boring list of apps, and I think that's good (also probably
forgot some). It means I didn't have to install dozens of small tools that are
not directly related to the development workflow.

But the combo of grabbing stuff I know from Linux and BSD with homebrew works
good enough for me.

So am I loving it? **No.**

Can I work with it? **Absolutely.**

Would I switch back to using Linux full time? **Yes, instantly.**

Just because of the small annoyances I have and because nothing is really
better on the mac except restoring window positions after unplugging monitors,
which is not a problem at all with my usual tiling setup.

I can see how people who only ever want to own one personal machine (usually
a laptp) and do a bit of everything, including developmont, would choose one.
For me the comparison to windows is not even a comparison, stuff just works
(just like on Linux, most of the time).
