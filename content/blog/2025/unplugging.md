There's been a [German blog
post](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/unplugtrump-mach-dich-digital-unabhaengig-von-trump-und-big-tech/)
going round the last few days, in the general tone of self-hosting and choosing
European-hosted alternatives, or just more community-focused and decentralized
than walled gardens, with a focus on US megacorps.

I found it quite interesting and of course I went along with the list and what
I use:

  1. "change your e-mail provider" - been self-hosting mail for decades, but still
     have a GMail address (for Android) and as a last resort (e.g. mailing my
boarding passes there in case of catastrophic failures of my mail server while
I am at the airport or away - I could only solve the latter with a freemailer
or bugging a friend).

  1. "use a privacy friendly search engine" - I am mostly on DuckDuckGo but
     I regularly fall back to Google because I am impatient when the results
are bad.

  1. "messengers without big brother" - Guess I fail here. I use Signal and
     Matrix and IRC, but I also use WhatsApp and Discord because that's where
people I want to talk to are. Would gladly scrap both.

  1. "the networking effect" - now this is mostly wishful thinking, I've spent
     enough time trying to convert people, it doesn't work for me.

  1. "open source voice assistant" - Pass, switched off on my Android voice
     thing, never used anything else either.

  1. "Fediverse/Mastodon" - Using that daily, have deleted Instagram and
     Twitter accounts, kept Facebook because I'm only logging in once a year
anyway and got tons of old contacts there, it's a "just in case" thing.

  1. "your own cloud" - I should probably migrate my calender from Google, but
     I don't need any other features here, I use Syncthing for some files.

  1. "calendar and addresses" - yeah, I was too quick with the last one. I have (hopefully
     unsynced) phone numbers in my Android phone, zero addresses there.

  1. "routing/maps" - Maybe I should get in the habit of using OSM more, but
     last time I tried it it wasn't great. Still using Google Maps often.

  1. "LibreOffice and co" - I've not used MS Office at home for probably 15
     years, I do have "unimportant" stuff in Google Docs.

  1. "PeerTube" - Yeah well, if I was publishing videos, maybe - but I don't
     see how it makes sense if you're watching stuff on YouTube that is... on
YouTube.

  1. "privacy friendly video calls" - Not sure when I last had a private video
     call, maybe twice in 2020/2021 - not going to speak up at work here, as
I don't really care for work stuff.

  1. "buy locally" - Guess this is where I am unabashedly an apologist, but
     I've always hated shopping (with a couple exceptions), so while I am
trying to use "local" online shops, unless it's clothing I am just so done with
local shops. I live in Munich and would expect them to have stuff available,
but everything I usually want needs to be ordered anyway, so I am saving myself
the hassle and just order it directly. And the customer experience at Amazon is
actually good 95% of the time, unlike with the typical German shop, online or
offline.

  1. "privacy friendly browser" - I guess this is the shit storm du jour with
     the latest Firefox news, but I've not been using Chrome for many years and
sticking with Firefox for now, but I also use LibreWolf and Vivaldi.

  1. "Android Custom ROM" - I might be wrong but this is just ridiculous. While
     I would very much like to have an open source OS there, the main killer
criterion is banking apps that detect root and other stuff I don't want to, but need to use.
I am not a smartphone person, I might play a game while waiting for the bus and
talk to people, but I *need* the 2FA apps for my bank.

  1. "avoid app tracking" - I think this is just needlessly making your life
     complicated - I know I am being tracked, I have given up. Play Store it
is because I don't think F-Droid on stock Android helps much here.

  1. "tech oligarchy bad, democracy good" - yes, I agree, I'm not sure I want
     to spend my free time endlessly researching which companies I should
avoid, it's probably too many of them. But if I do know about a connection to
certain people I will try to avoid them anyway.

  1. "use linux" - Yes, I've been doing that for many years and I wish it was
     a useful nudge people but it's usually not. I know tons of people that
basically use their computer because of 1 or several applications that exist on
Windows while having zero knowledge about tech. Everyone telling these people
to use linux should also provide free support. I'm actually just waiting for my
new graphics card to arrive then I will try to switch my main computer to
linux, it's been on windows ever since because of games.

  1. "video editing on  linux" - Kdenlive is good even on windows, but I've
     used it like twice in my life.

  1. "consuming news" - Kinda disagree with the premise that getting news from
     social media is bad. Well yes, of course *now* X is bad, but I get enough
news from the fediverse, just as it worked on Twitter before, if you choose
your bubble. Also yes, RSS is good and I use it a lot.

  1. "avoid paypal" - Another one that's really hard. I don't think there's
     a good alternative except using your credit card directly, but that's
still a lot more friction. The realtime transfers are a pipe dream, I think
I see this at a small minority of shops. Also EU only and I pay for digital
goods as well. I wish there was something, but PayPal is one of the top
5 online things making my life more enjoyable - easy payments.

  1. "ad blockers" - a no brainer, really

  1. "streaming music" - I have a Spotify account that I fire up a couple of
     times per year to listen to an album before buying it. Maybe not perfect,
but I can totally accept that.

  1. "open source AI" - just getting started/not using it anyway

  1. "home assistant and co" - I don't do IoT and smarthome, I have 2 shellys
     to measure power consumption from time to time.

  1. "vpn providers" - First thing I don't really have an opinion on, I've
     never paid for a VPN, I used to self-host, currently doing a couple things
with Tailscale.

  1. "tesla" - Does not apply, would never have bought one anyway, even if
     I was a person to buy an expensive new car, or use an electric one, or
need one at all.

  1. "catch all email and throwaway mobile number" - E-Mail is a given but I've
     never found a sim/setup for a price I liked so far. I try to just not give
my mobile number to services, but if I have to...

  1. "step up" - Another one where past me was more enthusiastic than current
     me.

  1. "touch grass" - Now this is just bullshit, I'm online as much as needed
     and staying offline helps no one. Of course you're not being track offline
but it's just not a real argument.


So, how are the results and where do I stand?

I have a feeling that I've already done most of the things that are either
important to me or not impossibly hard to do.

  - emails and messengers
  - social media
  - browsers
  - whatever software that can be self-hosted without going bankrupt

I also seem to have lost the will to do the right thing at any cost for my
personal happiness, you might call it laziness:

  - google calendar (but I actually might)
  - using google maps (guess I should try though)
  - google docs

Then there are the things where I personally judge my usage patterns to be
"non-compliant" enough to occasionally benefit and not do the right thing and
stop using them altoghether:

  - facebook account, hardly used
  - spotify acccount, hardly used

The things where I don't see a realistic alternative:

  - using whatsapp
  - using youtube

And finally there are a few things where I just don't want to spend the money
and or mental effort to fix it, or I don't see it as realistic for myself:

  - paying for a second SIM and
  - keeping a 2nd phone functional/updated, one for banking and one for
    everything else incl f-droid
  - not using amazon
  - not using paypal

Also interestingly I have zero problems buying *books* somewhere else than
Amazon, it's mostly specific household items and electronics where I would have
to find a physical shop (often impossible in a reasonable time) or spend 5-10
bucks more in a random shop for postage, or worse price.

While I disagree with some of the 30 things on the list, I'd say I mostly agree
- at least in spirit. I'm happy to help people transition away from some of
  those but I'm over zealous evangelizing.

Anyway, I think it's mostly a good list to think about and analyze your
behaviour, if it's not something that's on your mind all the time.
