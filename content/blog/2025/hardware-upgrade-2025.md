While I didn't really plan to (or need to) replace my [2019
Ryzen](/blog/2019/hardware-upgrade/) we had a gaming laptop act up (again,
actually), and so I decided it would be good to have a 2nd current-generation
gaming PC again, so I bought one. Mostly because of "it has worked for years
without problems", I gave
up mine and ordered some parts to build a new one for myself.
But of course that's not the only reason -
I was also eager to get some new hardware and run Linux on it.

Ignoring the graphics card, the other one was 5 years and 3 months old,
and not ignoring it 4 years and 2 months old. So not really a short time,
but I still hadn't replaced it because of its age. For comparison the last
upgrade cycle was 7.5 years (ignoring in-between upgrades)


 * AMD [Ryzen 7 9700X][ryzen7] 8x 3.80 GHz Socket AM5 WOF, 340 EUR
 * MSI [MAG Tomahawk WIFI AMD X870 So.AM5][x870], 315 EUR
 * Noctua [NH-D15S][noctua] CPU Cooler, 109 EUR
 * 2x32GB Crucial Pro DDR5-5600 DIMM, 155 EUR
 * 850W Seasonic [Focus GX-850][gx850] Modular PSU, 155 EUR
 * 2 TB WD Black SN850X M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 x4 3D-NAND TLC, 147 EUR
 * Fractal Design [Torrent Compact][torrentcompact], white, 136 EUR
 * Sapphire Pure AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT 16GB GDDR6, 2x HDMI, 2x DP, 799 EUR

At 2156 EUR it was more expensive than I had hoped, but as the last one was
cheaper than I had expected I'm not complaining.


Hardware I didn't replace:

 * Logitech G710+ MX Brown
 * Dell U2715H 27"
 * some SSD I'd need to look up, the rest stayed in the old Ryzen rig
 * HyperX Cloud Alpha Gaming Headset


Hardware I had replaced since 2019:

 * Dell S2721DGF 27" (main screen) instead of the Samsung 27"
 * Dell whatever 24" instead of the Samsung 24"
 * Roccat Kone Aimo instead of the Kone EMP


So now that's 2 Ryzen 7 (one AM4, one AM5) and I'm getting rid of an i5-4460
from 2014, because it doesn't make sense to replace my
[home server](/blog/2020/home-server/)'s i5-3570K, but I'm stealing the 8GB of
RAM which should fit. This will also retire the last spinning disk in regular
use.

The one thing I'm a bit sad about is that I will get rid of the case the i5
is sitting in, I bought it in May 1998 for the first computer I would build for
myself, a Pentium II-350 MHz. It's been spraypainted metallic blue (a Ford
color) from a can that was left over from fixing the paint job on my first
car, and has been in more or less continuous use for the last 27 years.
Hooray for standards (ATX).

As an aside, before the 9070 XT arrived I tried the RX470 from 2016 in this new
machine and I was surprised how well it held up.
