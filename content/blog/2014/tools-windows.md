Part two of a draft I had stashed away and forgotten. Here is part 1: [A boring list of tools for Linux Desktops](/blog/2014/tools-linux-desktop)

I've been writing lists like these for years (oldest I can find is from late 2005), but I've never gone into that much detail like [this one, for example](http://www.hanselman.com/tools) - he seems to have a specialized thing (GUI tool) for almost every task. Maybe that's the way to be productive on Windows, I have mostly given up to do any meaningful work. For what I call *work* I take a laptop with Linux and only in extreme cases work with `PuTTY` for ssh. Well, and a browser, of course.

## My <s>workstation</s> [playstation](/blog/2012/hardware-upgrade)

  * OS: `Windows 7 64 bit`
  * Browsers:
    * `Chrome` - *default browser, nearly everything*
    * `Firefox` - *mostly gaming websites and stuff*
    * `IronPortable` - *yes, I have a dedicated Facebook browser*
    * `ChromePortable` - *and one for work email and logins*
  * E-Mail: `Thunderbird` (extensions see below)
  * IRC: `Quassel`
  * Audio/Video: `foobar2000`, `vlc`, `MP3Tag`
  * Editors: `Notepad2`, `LightTable`, `MarkdownPad`, testing `Atom` atm (unimpressed)
  * Jabber: `PidginPortable`
  * Voice: `TS3`, `Mumble`
  * Misc: `BTSync`, `f.lux`, `ClipX`, `PuTTY`, `IrfanView`, `KeyTweak`, `SumatraPDFPortable`, `7-Zip`, `TrueCrypt` and `WinSplit Revolution`
  * Programming stuff I actually use sometimes: `leiningen`, `eclipse`, `msysgit`
  * Some rarely used `PortableApps`: `Audacity`, `CDEx`, `FileZilla`, `InfraRecorder`
  * Random stuff: python, `sbt`, `Racket`, `VirtualBox`, `Julia` (all in mint condition)
  * Finally stuff that's more or less cool but I don't need: `AutoHotKey`, `ConEmu`, `chocolatey`, `GitHub for Windows`, `Synergy`

After many years of a totally clean desktop I've began using it again. For Games.

To conclude, a list of Thunderbird addons:

  * `Enigmail` - *GPG*
  * `Lightning` - *Calendar*
  * `Sieve` - *Mail filter*
  * `ConfirmFolderMove` - *avoid fatfingering stupid actions*
  * `Quote Highlight` - *improve readability*
  * `Flexible Identity` - *don't reply as bozo@bogusdomain if it was sent to krusty@bogusdomain*

and Chromium addons:

  * `Enhanced Steam`
  * `Facebook Disconnect`
  * `FlashBlock`
  * `Privacy Badger`
  * `TweetDeck`

Oh, and just for fun here's the tools that were on my 2005 list already :)

  * `Notepad2`
  * `IrfanView`
  * `Firefox` (I know I used Phoenix already)
  * `FileZilla`
  * `CDEx`
  * `7-Zip`
  * `MP3Tag`
  * `Audacity`
  * `eclipse`
  * `vlc` (but not as default)

Damn, seems it's hard for me to break habits. Extra thanks for the developers of those tools I am still using after nearly 9 years.
