For a while I've been annoying my colleagues with random links I've found
 interesting. They might be related to the project we're working on or stuff
 we've talked about. Maybe they're not that random after all, but the infamous
 mails titled "Linkdump" might be useful to someone, so I've started
 [The Stack](/stack), where I'll hopefully manage to push a list of links
 every week, starting with last week, [Week 44/2011](/stack/2011/week-44).

Many of those links are from [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com),
 and some inspiration is taken from [the left fold](http://www.foldl.org)
 (sadly not updated anymore) and [trivium](http://chneukirchen.org/trivium).

Maybe I'll post the months prior to November 2011 in monthly sets, but probably not.

Oh, and there's a separate feed for it: [The Stack](/stack/atom.xml).

**Update 2016-11-09:** I'm always interested in more link dumps for various topics.

So here's a list of related lists. (How meta.)

  * [trivium](http://chneukirchen.org/trivium) is still going strong
  * [fogus](http://blog.fogus.me) has been posting links for a while now
  * [R.I.Pienaar](http://us14.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=48a10a5d8254d034473c9ca1c&id=38d0f6d5e9) recently started, sadly it's a newsletter
