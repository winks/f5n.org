As I started a new job in October I'm anticipating to learn a lot of things in
a short timespan in the coming weeks, and because in the past I was bad about
writing stuff down I've resolved to do better and write stuff down.
Or not let what I wrote down rot in a couple of files
called `~/Documents/notes.md` that wer kept for a year or longer at at time.
Maybe I can even extract some knowledge from some of these old ones...

So there's a new category on this site: [TIL](/til) with small snippets of
knowledge, in the hopes that cleaning up my notes for publishing will be enough
of a repetition to help memorize it.

The name was inspired by [Simon Willison: TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/)
when I saw a post on [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs) recently and remembered I'd
seen the site before.
So I guess the concept is not new or unique,
in my old blog I posted small bits of
knowledge interspersed with normal blog posts and long articles all the time,
but for some reason over 10 years ago I stopped.

Fun side story: I wasn't 100% sure if my own [static stite generator][nextgen]
would be able to handle this new category with all its differences or if I had
hardcoded too much. It seemed to work, I was just missing support for tags, but
even for that I found a branch from September 2023 which mostly did what it
should already.

The second thing is that I tweaked the CSS a bit. Ran the W3C validator,
removed the moz-box-shadow et al that have probably been in there for 10 years,
and cleaned up the header section. Time will tell if I like it enough to keep
it. Also the breadcrumbs are gone for now.
