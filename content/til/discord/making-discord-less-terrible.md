Discord has terrible defaults and apparently you need to set them again
every time you install it.

### Windows Settings:

```
[ ] Open Discord on Startup
[ ] Close Button Minimized to Tray
```

### Data & Privacy:

```
[ ] Use data to improve Discord
[ ] Use my Discord activity to personalize Sponsored Content
```

### Notifications:

#### Sounds:

```
[x] Disable All Notification Sounds
```

### Streamer Mode:

```
[ ] Enable Streamer Mode
[ ] Automatically Enable/Disable
```

### Game Overlay:

```
[ ] Currently Playing
[ ] Enable Overlay
[ ] Enable Legacy Overlay
```

### Voice & Video:

```
[x] Push to Talk
```

and then actually set a key.
