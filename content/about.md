This is an example of a WordPress page.

Just kidding, but it's been a while that I've written an about page.
None of them were decent or funny. But I won't stop writing one every few years.

### About the author

This is the website of Florian Anderiasch, a Software Developer from Munich, Germany. Hi!

I'm going to spare you the details, but most of my time is spent building web
applications or other software, poking servers, creating open source software,
playing games or ranting. I rant a lot.

Around ten years ago I would have written "About the webmaster".

In the late nineties I might have written "wEbMaSTeR". Well, maybe I did. The
times they are a-changing. I'm also not wearing any online gaming clan tag in
front of my nick anymore, nor coding in VB5 or using AOL.

The first webpage I put up (on geocities probably) in the summer of '98 started
a career of creating webapps, enjoying server-side scripting languages and
loathing javascript.

In 2011 I wrote:

The degree's still there, but apart from that I'm writing mostly Python and Lua
these days, using a lot more Puppet than is healthy for my sanity, only
occasionally work with PHP, even less with JavaScript (whew) and am not
actively working on learning new languags, although coming back to Haskell
once in a while, played with Racket for a few weeks and on my to-do list as of
summer 2014 are: Go, Rust and Julia, maybe Idris. I actually learned a little
Ruby in the last year and while not perfect, I see some strengths now.

### About this website

This awe-inspiring website was originally made with [Hyde][] and [Vim][].
Both choices were to a small degree inspired by posts by [Steve Losh][sjl],
although I've had read about Hyde before and had used Vim for ages.
But in both cases his excellent articles tipped the point.

In August of 2013 I threw out [Blueprint][] and replaced the CSS with a
responsive layout done in [Foundation][]. The only JavaScript you'll find
on this website is [Piwik][], although I hardly look at the visits. How useful!

Technically speaking, most static site generators transform [Markdown][] to
HTML and in m case a Makefile does all the plumbing. Not fancy at all.

In January of 2015 I switched over to [hugo][] because of the faster page
generation, the better docs and there being an actual community. I still use
Vim exclusively for updating though.

Earlier incarnations (of which many never even went public) included [Django][],
[Silex][] and several handcrafted CMS. Didn't we all write those from ca. 2000 to 2005?

For blogs I've used Wordpress, [Serendipity][], and booq, which was my guestbook-turned-blogsoftware
that's been live in version 2.0 as early as 2002. I can only guess 1.0 was some horrible mess.
My guess is that I've looked into 3/4 of all at least semi-popular weblog engines written in PHP, Python,
Ruby and Perl, yet never used them in production.
