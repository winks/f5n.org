### Agile

 - [Tuleap][Tuleaporgwebsiteoftheopensourceproject] - sounds too good to be true, probably doesn't work as advertised

### Books

 - [The Electrical experimenter][Theelectricalexperimenter] - an archive of 1916-1917 issues of [Hugo Gernsback][hugogernsback]'s magazine about amateur radio stuff, electric gadgets, science and other stuff. Fascinating read and so much more detailed than contemporary magazines, although I can't check the facts :P
