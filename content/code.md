### My projects

You'll find most of my code on these communities:

  * [codeberg][]
  * [github][]
  * [bitbucket][]
  * [pear][]


### Remarkable? I don't know

  * [media_mogilefs][] - A MogileFS Stream Wrapper to store files for Drupal
  * [cinder][] - An eclipse plug-in to display Continuous Integration stuff in your IDE
  * [padawan][] - static code analysis for PHP, now dead and integrated into [phpmd][]


### Other stuff

Over the years I've been involved in some projects, here's a quick summary:

  * I used to run [izlude.de][], a highly-praised forum-signature generator for [Ragnarok Online][euroro]
  * Helped with translating the German PHP manual
  * Occasionally trying to clear the PHP bug tracker by diagnosing and (sometimes) bugfixing
  * Was active in the [Serendipity][] community for a while
  * Helping out with [phpMyFAQ][] development
  * I'm the poor soul trying to triage the windows bugs in [Leiningen][]
