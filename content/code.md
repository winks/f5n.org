You'll find most of my public code here:

  * [codeberg][]
  * [github][] (although I am trying to migrate off at the moment)


### Some recent projects I am actively using

  * [nextgen][] - static site generator in Rust, powering this page
  * [Jerssey][] - a cross-platform podcast episode tracker in Qt/C++
  * [jerssey-backend-go][jbg] - the accompanying Golang backend
  * [WastedTime][] - track the time certain apps are active - Rust/Windows
  * [multiplex][] - a tumble log/soup.io clone written in Clojure

### Other stuff

Over the years I've been involved in some projects, here's a quick summary:

  * I used to run [izlude.de][], a highly-praised forum-signature generator for [Ragnarok Online][euroro]
  * Helped with translating the German PHP manual
  * Tried to clear the PHP bug tracker by diagnosing and (sometimes) bugfixing
  * Was active in the [Serendipity][] community for a while
  * Helping out with [phpMyFAQ][] development
  * I'm the poor soul trying to triage the windows bugs in [Leiningen][]
